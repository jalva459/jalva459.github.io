Throughout my career, I've explored the intersections between environment and people. I firmly believe that environmental progress comes from a fundamental understanding of our study system(s) and the support of the general public. For this reason, I strive to increase the amount of available information about diverse species and biological systems through impactful research and commit to making scientific information accessible through education and outreach. 

My main research interests lie within understanding neotropical & tropical forest interactions, processes, and assemblages as they change throughout time. 

I’m currently based at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, where I work as a post-baccalaureate RaMP-Up Research Fellow and I explore the use of molecular and genomic techniques for understanding forest assemblages and plant-fungal interactions.
